- Function to print the game board to the console.
- Function to handle player moves by updating the game board with the player's symbol in the appropriate location.
- Function to check for a win by examining rows, columns, and diagonals for three of the same symbols in a row.
- Function to check for a tie when the game board is full without any player achieving three in a row.
- Main game loop that alternates between two players, prompting them for their moves and checking for win or tie conditions.
- Ability to choose between 'X' and 'O' symbols at the start of the game.
- Option to play again or exit after the game ends.
